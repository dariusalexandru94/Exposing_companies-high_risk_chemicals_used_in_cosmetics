# High risk chemicals used in cosmetics

This report is based on data provided by **California Health and Human Services Open 
Data Portal** (https://data.chhs.ca.gov/) and official reports of International Agency for Research 
on Cancer (IARC), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA). **It aims to identify the most high risk chemicals used in cosmetics** from 
the California market, **what kind of products** contain such substances that pose a major risk to 
human use and **which are the companies that use them**. This report provides insights just into the 
State of California cosmetics market and cannot be generalized due to factors like legislation 
(example: EU has much stricter legislation on cosmetics that other countries) or market diversity in 
U.S. (example: some products are only found in California).
